      "answers": {
        "a": "Ductile material",

        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Maximum principal stress theory is not suitable for ductile materials.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Different failure theories apply to ductile and brittle materials separately.",
        "c": "Correct. Maximum principal stress (Rankine’s theory) is applicable to brittle materials.",

        "c": "Both ductile and brittle",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Maximum shear stress theory (Tresca theory) is mainly applicable to ductile materials.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Brittle materials fail due to normal stress rather than shear stress.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Shear stress theory is primarily for ductile materials.",

        "a": "Both the ends threaded",
        "b": "Head one end to other end fit into a tapped hole in the other part to be joined",

        "d": "A head on one end and nut fitted to the other"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes a stud.",
        "b": "Correct. A tap bolt has a head on one end and is screwed into a tapped hole without using a nut.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Pointed threads are common in screws, not tap bolts.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That describes a standard bolt used with a nut."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Slotted nuts are used where locking arrangements are required.",
        "b": "Incorrect. There is no standard term called an 'Allen nut'.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Allen bolts do not require a specific nut type.",
        "d": "Correct. Allen bolts can be used with various types of nuts depending on application."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While there are many thread forms, the commonly classified basic types are fewer.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Four is not the standard basic classification count.",
        "c": "Correct. Screw threads are commonly classified into three basic types: V-thread, square thread, and trapezoidal thread.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There are more than two basic thread types."
