<b style="font-size: 1.6em; color: black;">Screw Head Forming Simulation - Documentation</b>

This folder contains the styling and simulation documentation for the **Cold Heading** of fasteners.

### Process Overview
The simulations demonstrate the **Upsetting** (Heading) process used to form heads on standard bolts, hexagonal bolts, and screws.
- **Material:** Plain Carbon Steel.
- **Condition:** Cold Heading (20°C).
- **Mechanism:** Mechanical press deformation using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for force distribution.



### Interactive Layout
The interface uses a vertical, dynamic navigation system:
- **Guided Prompts:** Each simulation includes a technical "Call to Action" to guide student observation.
- **Focused View:** Hiding inactive videos ensures a scannable and professional lab environment.
- **Strain & Force Analysis:** Integrated graphs plot the relationship between Pilot Height and Punch Force to correlate deformation with mechanical property enhancement.

### Folder Structure
- `index.html`: The interactive simulation interface.
- `css/main.css`: Professional layout and video-card styling.
- `Assets`: 6 MP4 simulation videos covering setup and strain analysis.
