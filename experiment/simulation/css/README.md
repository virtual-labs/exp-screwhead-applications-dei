# Experiment 2: CSS and Simulation Resources

This folder contains the styling and assets for the **Screw Head Forming** experiment.

## Files
- `main.css`: Controls the layout for the 6 simulation videos. It includes specific styling for:
  - Video players (shadows and borders).
  - Technical description boxes (background and justified text).
  - Headings for different bolt types (Bolt, Hexagonal Bolt, and Screw).

## Simulation Content
The simulation covers the cold heading process, material deformation (plain carbon steel at 20°C), and equivalent strain analysis.
