    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Screw bolt is formed by heading operation. Heading process can be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod. In the given simulation of screw forming, cold heading process is used. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. By Considering the various parameters of heading simulation like force, temp etc. like temperature of the billet is 20°C and In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video we can see the manufacturing of screw bolt. In the right hand top side we can see the upper die, lower die and initial billet, final billet. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in billet during the operation.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In the left hand side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the heading operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 3.36107. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation by the graph. Graph plot between the pilot height and punch.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hexagonal bolt is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod or wire or blank. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of hexagonal bolt forming, cold heading process is used. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. The temperature of the billet is 20°C. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video one can see the processing of hexagonal bolt. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the upper die or punch and lower die and initial billet and final billet. In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in the billet during the heading operation.</p>

Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 3.21625. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the variation of strain with mesh in the billet during the operation. Similarly in the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the graph. Graph plot between punch and pilot height.</p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Screw is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod in order to produce a larger cross-section. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of screw forming, cold heading process is used. The screw forming is normally done in two steps but for ease of the simulation, screw is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. the temperature of the billet is 20°C. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video one can see the processing of the screw. In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the upper die, lower die, initial billet and final billet. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation e in the billet during the operation.</p>
