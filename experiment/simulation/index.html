                <p>Screw bolt is formed by heading operation. Heading process can be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod. In the given simulation of screw forming, cold heading process is used. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. By Considering the various parameters of heading simulation like force, temp etc. like temperature of the billet is 20oC and In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video we can see the manufacturing of screw bolt. In the right hand top side we can see the upper die, lower die and initial billet, final billet. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in billet during the operation.</p>

                <p>Screw is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod in order to produce a larger cross-section. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of screw forming, cold heading process is used. The screw forming is normally done in two steps but for ease of the simulation, screw is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. the temperature of the billet is 20oC. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force.
